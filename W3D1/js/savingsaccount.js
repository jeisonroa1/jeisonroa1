/*In addition to the attributes of Account, SavingsAccount
should have an interest variable, which is set in the constructor and has a getter and a setter
mehtod. It should also have an addInterest() method which deposits the interest amount
into the account. The calculation for the amount is balance * interest / 100 . Be sure to also
overwrite the toString() method, and create Mocha / Chai tests for the methods in
SavingsAccount. You do not have to test the methods that SavingsAccount receives
from Account, since theyâ€™ve already been tested in Account.
